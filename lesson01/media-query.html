            <h2>1 Nephi 4:1</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying:
                Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful
                in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier
                than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty,
                yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our
                Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your
                foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
                yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty
                storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you
                down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which
                ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men
                build they cannot fall.</p>
